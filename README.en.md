# OpenClaw Office

> [中文文档](./README.md)

> Visualize AI agent collaboration as a real-time digital twin office.

**OpenClaw Office** is the visual monitoring and management frontend for the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) Multi-Agent system. It renders Agent work status, collaboration links, tool calls, and resource consumption through an isometric-style virtual office scene, along with a full-featured console for system management and a Chat workspace for real-time Agent conversations.

**Core Metaphor:** Agent = Digital Employee | Office = Agent Runtime | Desk = Session | Meeting Pod = Collaboration Context

---

## Features

### Virtual Office

- **2D Floor Plan** — SVG-rendered isometric office with desk zones, hot desks, meeting areas, and rich furniture (desks, chairs, sofas, plants, coffee cups)
- **Agent Avatars** — Deterministically generated SVG avatars from agent IDs with real-time status animations (idle, working, speaking, tool calling, error)
- **Collaboration Lines** — Visual connections showing inter-Agent message flow
- **Speech Bubbles** — Live Markdown text streaming and tool call display
- **Side Panels** — Agent details, Token line charts, cost pie charts, activity heatmaps, SubAgent relationship graphs, event timelines

### Chat Workspace

- Dedicated Chat workspace accessible via top navigation (`/#/chat`), with the dock bar retained as a quick-entry surface
- Session management — create new sessions, switch history, route by Agent, support multi-Agent parallel conversations
- Real-time streaming — stream AI responses with abort/resend support
- Persistent chat history — server-side per-day sharded cache (`~/.openclaw/office-cache/chat/`), stable across browsers, devices, and refreshes
- Tool call visualization — inline Agent tool call status (calling/completed), collapsible for detail viewing
- Slash commands — `/help`, `/new`, `/reset`, `/model`, `/think`, `/export` and more
- Attachments — support for images and arbitrary file attachments
- Utilities — search, Markdown export, focus mode, pinned-reference workflows

### Console

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+**
- **pnpm** (package manager)
- **[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)** installed and configured

OpenClaw Office is a companion frontend that connects to a running OpenClaw Gateway. It does **not** start or manage the Gateway itself.

---

## Quick Launch

The fastest way to run OpenClaw Office — no cloning required:

```bash
# Run directly (one-time)
npx @ww-ai-lab/openclaw-office

# Or install globally
npm install -g @ww-ai-lab/openclaw-office
openclaw-office
```

### Gateway Token Auto-Detection

If [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is installed locally, the Gateway auth token is **automatically detected** from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` — no manual configuration needed.

You can also provide the token explicitly:

```bash
openclaw-office --token <your-gateway-token>
# or via environment variable
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=<token> openclaw-office
```

### CLI Options

| Flag                  | Description           | Default                |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `-t, --token <token>` | Gateway auth token    | auto-detected          |
| `-g, --gateway <url>` | Gateway WebSocket URL | `ws://localhost:18789` |
| `-p, --port <port>`   | Server port           | `5180`                 |
| `--host <host>`       | Bind address          | `0.0.0.0`              |
| `-h, --help`          | Show help             | —                      |

> **Note:** This serves the pre-built production bundle. For development with hot reload, see [Development](#development) below.

---

## Quick Start (from source)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure Gateway Connection

Create a `.env.local` file (gitignored) with your Gateway connection details:

```bash
cat > .env.local << 'EOF'
VITE_GATEWAY_URL=ws://localhost:18789
VITE_GATEWAY_TOKEN=<your-gateway-token>
EOF
```

Get your Gateway token:

```bash
openclaw config get gateway.auth.token
```

### 3. Start the Gateway

Ensure the OpenClaw Gateway is running on the configured address (default `localhost:18789`). You can start it via:

- The OpenClaw macOS app
- `openclaw gateway run` CLI command
- Other deployment methods (see [OpenClaw documentation](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw))

### 4. Start the Dev Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5180` in your browser.

### Environment Variables

| Variable                | Required                              | Default                | Description                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `VITE_GATEWAY_URL`      | No                                    | `ws://localhost:18789` | Gateway WebSocket address            |
| `VITE_GATEWAY_WS_PATH`  | No                                    | `/gateway-ws`          | Browser-side reverse proxy WS path   |
| `VITE_GATEWAY_TOKEN`    | Yes (when connecting to real Gateway) | —                      | Gateway auth token                   |
| `VITE_MOCK`             | No                                    | `false`                | Enable mock mode (no Gateway needed) |

### Mock Mode (No Gateway)

To develop without a running Gateway, enable mock mode:

```bash
VITE_MOCK=true pnpm dev
```

This uses simulated Agent data for UI development.

## Development

### Commands

```bash
pnpm install              # Install dependencies
pnpm dev                  # Start dev server (port 5180)
pnpm build                # Production build
pnpm test                 # Run tests
pnpm test:watch           # Test watch mode
pnpm typecheck            # TypeScript type check
pnpm lint                 # Oxlint linting
pnpm format               # Oxfmt formatting
pnpm check                # lint + format check
```

### Architecture

OpenClaw Office connects to the Gateway via WebSocket and follows this data flow:

```
OpenClaw Gateway  ──WebSocket──>  ws-client.ts  ──>  event-parser.ts  ──>  Zustand Store  ──>  React Components
     │                                                                          │
     └── RPC (agents.list, chat.send, ...)  ──>  rpc-client.ts  ──────────────>─┘
```

The Gateway broadcasts real-time events (`agent`, `presence`, `health`, `heartbeat`) and responds to RPC requests. The frontend maps Agent lifecycle events to visual states (idle, working, speaking, tool_calling, error) and renders them in the office scene.

### Session Synchronization Strategy

- Real-time Agent and SubAgent state, 2D office walking animation, and meeting-zone movement are driven directly by WebSocket `agent` events
- `sessions.list` is no longer used as a high-frequency real-time driver; it is used for immediate sync after connection and a **60-second** low-frequency reconciliation pass to recover from missed events and reconnect drift, while reusing the same response for token aggregation
- This strategy reduces Gateway CPU pressure and avoids letting high-frequency full-session scans interfere with other RPC probes
